#comment in python uses #
if spam_amount > 0:
  print ("But I don't want ANY spam!") #conditional 
  : #indicated end of code block
      indentndation are part of that block of code
#Strings can be single or double quotes. 

###Numbers and Arithmetic in Python 

spam = 0 
type (spam_amount) -> int
19.95 -> float

###Operators 

a+b addition 
a-b subtraction
a*b multiplication 
a/b true division 
a//b floor division #removes fractional parts
a%b modulus #integer remainer after ivision of a by b 
a**b exponentiation 
-a negation 
#follows PEMDAS

##Built in functions working with numbers

print(min(1,2,3)
print(max(1,2,3)
print(abs(32))

##int and float can be functions
print(float(10)) -> 10.0

##Exercise: Syntax, Variables, and Numbers

#1

pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter / 2

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * radius ** 2

#2 
#swap variables a and b 
tmp = a 
a = b 
b = tmp 

#3
#add ()
#5 - 3 // 2 -> 4

Alice, Bob and Carol have agreed to pool their Halloween candy and split it evenly among themselves. For the sake of their friendship, any candies left over will be smashed. For example, if they collectively bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30 each and smash 1.
Write an arithmetic expression below to calculate how many candies they must smash for a given haul.
# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and carol
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77
carol_candies = 109

# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies
to_smash = ( alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies) % 3
